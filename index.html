									<p>I'm a born-and-raised Californian originally from the Monterey Bay. I started my academic career as a fifth-generation student at UC Berkeley. I initially wanted to study Psychology, but fell in love with Linguistics after taking an introductory course for my Psychology degree. I settled on a double major and graduated the day of my 21st birthday. As an undergraduate, I was involved in many interdisciplinary labs, which you can read about in my <a href="#cv">CV</a>.</p>
									<p>Now I work as a researcher at UCSF in the <a href="http://changlab.ucsf.edu/" target="_blank">Chang Lab</a> where I keep busy giving a physiological reality to my love for linguistics. You can read more about my <a href="#research">research interests</a> here.</p>
									<p>When I'm not immersed in brains or phonemes (or both, ideally), I spend my free time backpacking, playing Magic, and practicing the mandolin.</p>

								<p>How do we acquire language, how do we store it, and how do we adapt it? These are the questions that intrigue me as a researcher. My clinical experiences at UCSF have inspired me to discover as much as I can about how language manifests itself in our neural architecture: even when presented with the adversity of a large temporal lobe tumor, language can reorganize around the malignant tissue, proving it is one slippery beast to pin down. The sheer volume of biological resources we devote to acquiring this social tool demonstrates its importance. Yet there is more to be learned, and nothing is more exciting to me.</p>

								<p>I plan on pursuing a doctorate studying the neural plasticity of language, whether it be in infants (the best linguists in the world) or in those unfortunate enough to have their language impaired by a tumor or traumatic brian injury. I am currently looking at different programs and hope to start my studies in Fall 2018.</p>

									<h3>Education</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>University of California, Berkeley (2012-2015). B.A. in Linguistics and Psychology.</li>
										</ul>

									<h3>Research Statement</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>I am interested in the reorganization of language in the brain in both pediatric (L1 acquisition) and adult (TBI, resective surgery) populations. I believe methods with high spatiotemporal resolution (CSM, ECoG) are critical in answering the most important questions regarding neural representations of speech and language.</li>
