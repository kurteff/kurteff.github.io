								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg"></span>
									<p>I am a California-Texas-California trans-transplant. I started in Linguistics and Psychology at UC Berkeley, but my research career really began in the <a href="http://changlab.ucsf.edu/">Chang Lab</a> at UCSF (check my <a href="#cv">CV</a> for the whole story). In the Chang Lab, I realized that brain/language researchers were a thing, and I wanted to be one. I worked with patients who had tumors in the parts of their brain critical for language. Before surgery, I prepared them for what to expect afterwards and collected a baseline language evaluation. During surgery, I helped the surgeon identify which parts of the cortex were important for linguistic function via electrocortical stimulation. I then followed up with these patients after surgery and documented their recovery from transient aphasias (difficulties perceiving and producing language) related to swelling from the surgical procedure. Results from my time in the Chang Lab are published in the scientific journals <i>Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</i>, <i>Neurosurgery</i>, and <i>Nature Human Behavior</i>, among others.</p>
									
									<p>I noticed a disconnect between researchers and clinicians/therapists while working hands-on with brain tumor patients at UCSF. Widely accepted theories about how the brain "does" language put forth by brilliant academic minds didn't always line up with how the brain "didn't" do language in the cases of individuals with aphasia and/or other neurogenic communication disorders. Even when the theory did line up with the patient, where to go from there isn't always clear (how does knowing this stuff help people?). I consider myself a clinician-scientist, or someone working to bridge the gap between theory and treatment, and I consider patient interaction to be a fundamental experience for any scientist looking to advance our theoretical perspectives on the brain and language.</p>

									<p> I did my PhD with Dr. Liberty Hamilton in Austin, Texas, where my doctoral research focused on the neural bases of auditory-motor feedback processing (or, what our brain does with the sound of our own voice). I then worked as a postdoctoral scientist in Dr. Greg Hickok's lab at UC Irvine as a part of the <a href="https://cstar.sc.edu/">C-STAR</a> grant. There, my goal was to separate out nuanced differences in speech errors are made using patterns of damage to the brain. If a patient says "pessel" for "pencil," is that a problem with the language system or the motor system? This is a difficult judgment for many speech therapists to make and hopefully the brain can give us some clues on how to better differentially diagnose people with expressive aphasia and apraxia of speech. I am now at the Memory and Aging Center at UCSF as part of the <a href="https://albalab.ucsf.edu/">ALBA Language Neurobiology Lab</a> headed by Dr. Marilu Gorno-Tempini, where my goal of investigating damage to the motor coordination system during speech continues but now in patients with neurodegenerative disorders that affect their ability to communicate. I am also <i>finally</i> finishing my clinical license as a speech-language pathologist (hard to find time for that as a full-time researcher!).

									<p>Ultimately, I hope that the foundational work I do on separating streams of auditory, motor, and linguistic processing in the brain can be tapped into for use in rehabilitative medicine. Specifically, I would like to develop assistive brain-computer interfaces for people with neurological motor and speech disorders, either as a professor building my research program or as a scientist at a company that develops such devices.</p>

									<p>Outside of research, I enjoy playing Magic: The Gathering, collecting fountain pens, building guitar pedals, and birdwatching. Most of my free time is occupied by the four freeloaders that live in my house (pictured below).</p>

								<p><i><small><center>Raw EEG recorded from my brain</center></small></i></p>

								<p>As a neuroscientist, linguist, and speech-language pathologist, my research spans a broad interdisciplinary area concerning how the brain gives rise to language. Specifically, I like to straddle the line between clinical practice and basic science research by expanding our knowledge of neural processes that break down in communication disorders. For my PhD research, this focused on speaker-induced suppression, the observation that sounds we produce yield less of a neural response than sounds produced by other people. Speaker-induced suppression is an important biomarker for the speech motor control system, which governs how (among other things) we use our real-time auditory feedback while speaking to ensure we speak accurately to our intentions. Speech motor control is an important cognitive process for several communication disorders, such as stuttering, aphasia, and apraxia of speech.</p>

								<p>My long-term goal as a researcher is to translate to our knowledge of the 
								neural basis of speech production and into "brain-to-speech" brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). I believe that a strong theoretical explanation of how linguistic processes work in the brain is imperative for such devices to exist. I would like to see both consumer and medical BCI for speech and language developed in my lifetime. Right now BCI are being developed for decoding intended speech from neural motor programs, but what if there is a breakdown in the system? How do we adapt our encoding and decoding algorithms to accomodate for apraxia of speech and aphasia? What could creating such a device teach us about these communication disorders?</p>

								<p>I also have a thing about scientific communication, or how scientists like me can make our results understood by the general public and other relevant professions (in my case: neurologists and speech therapists). More specifically, the classic Broca/Wernicke model of language needs to be updated in theory, in medicine, and in undergraduate curricula. At UCSF, I met with patients who had Broca's area resected with no damage to their speech and language functionality just two days after their surgeries. The language network can function without one of the two "fundamental" brain regions, but why? Similarly, I believe there needs to be more room for the insula in neurobiological models of language. Working with stereo EEG depth electrodes during my PhD uncovered a lot of fascinating responses to speech stimuli in the insula: my reseach shows that the insula plays a role in perception and production, and critically, the integration of these dichotomized processes for processing auditory feedback during speech motor control. The absence of the insula from the textbooks generated by my field is, in my opinion, a byproduct of the "pial-centric" view of the neurobiology of language. </p>

									<h3>Research Toolkit</h3>
										<ul>
											<li>
												I have experience with a wide variety of neuroimaging techniques; here they are in rough order of proficiency: sEEG, ECoG, EEG, cortical stimulation mapping, structural MRI, functional MRI
											</li>
											<li>
												Whenever possible, I prefer to use Python for my research. I am comfortable in MATLAB and R as well, and I sometimes use Swift (Apple flavor of C) for task design. Most of my code is available on my <a href="https://github.com/kurteff">GitHub</a>. See the below section for examples of projects where I served a primary role in developing code.
											</li>
											<li>
												I am trained as a speech-language pathologist and I am currently pursuing licensure as a clinical fellow. I take pride in having collected the behavioral data for most of my publications myself.
											</li>
											<li>
												Most of my quantitative methods fall under the broad umbrellas of linear regression and non-parametric statistics. I have dabbled in machine learning and Bayesian statistics and I often find myself grappling with the tradeoffs between interpretability and predictive power, tending to lean in the direction of simpler, less predictive, but more interpretable models as I find those more useful when trying to incorporate my findings into the broader field. This nuance is a soapbox of mine and I am always happy to discuss it. Some analytic approaches I've used in the past are (non-exhaustive): multivariate temporal receptive field modeling, multivariate voxel-based lesion symptom mapping, voxel-based morphometry, convex non-negative matrix factorization, canonical correlation analysis.
											</li>
											<li>
												I've become familiar with a variety of image and audio processing software in my research, including Praat, MRIcron/MRIcroGL, SPM, FreeSurfer, ffmpeg, Audacity, and Adobe Illustrator.

												For typesetting I am experienced in LaTeX and HTML/CSS (in that order). I enjoy making custom Beamer templates for presentations, which can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/kurteff">GitHub</a>. Paperpile is my favorite reference manager.

									<h3>Code Portfolio</h3>
									Below is a sampling of projects that I contributed to in the role of primary programmer:
										<ul>
											<li>
												<code>gl_utils</code>: tiny Python package containing optimizations and visualization scripts for Chris Rorden's <a href="https://www.nitrc.org/projects/mricrogl">MRIcroGL</a>. This one is still in development as I add new tools I find useful in my research.
												<a href="https://github.com/kurteff/gl_utils">[repo]</a>
											</li>
											<li>
												<code>cnlsm</code>: Python implementation of the critical network lesion-symptom mapping package utilized in my 2025 preprint (<a href="https://doi.org/10.64898/2025.12.16.694760">[doi]</a> <a href="assets/pdf/kurteff2025manuscript.pdf">[pdf]</a>) and a forthcoming methods paper (soon!). Original code written by Grant Walker in MATLAB which was then debugged, modularized, and ported into Python by me.
												<a href="https://github.com/kurteff/cnlsm">[repo] <i>(currently private but will be made public when preprint is posted!)</i>
											</li>
											<li>
												<code>kimg_pipe</code>: fork of <a href="https://github.com/ChangLabUcsf/img_pipe">img_pipe</a>, originally described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.3389/fninf.2017.00062">this paper</a>, which I modified to have more streamlined electrode marking functionality, including compatibility with <a href="https://www.zimmerbiomet.com/en/products-and-solutions/zb-edge/robotics/rosa-brain.html">ROSA</a> surgical robots, alongslide a slew of minor optimizations/visualization tools and helper functions.
												<a href="https://github.com/kurteff/kimg_pipe">[repo]</a>
											</li>
											<li>
												<code>kurteff2024_code</code>: code used in my 2024 manuscript (<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.1109-24.2024">[doi]</a> <a href="assets/pdf/kurteff2024manuscript.pdf">[pdf]</a>). Preprocessing and analysis of intracranial sEEG data using MNE-python as a backend. Imaging pipeline also uses some MATLAB. Task coded in Swift.
												<a href="https://github.com/HamiltonLabUT/kurteff2024_code">[repo]</a> 
											</li>
											<li>
												<code>speaker_induced_suppression_EEG</code>: code used in my 2023 manuscript (<a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_02037">[doi]</a> <a href="assets/pdf/kurteff2023manuscript.pdf">[pdf]</a>). Preprocessing and analysis of scalp EEG data using MNE-python as a backend. Linear mixed-effects models fit in R. EMG artifact correction implemented in MATLAB. Task coded in Swift.
