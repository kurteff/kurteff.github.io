								<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic01.jpg"></span>
									<p>I'm originally from the Monterey Bay. I did my undergrad in Psychology and Linguistics at UC Berkeley. I split my time in undergraduate between three labs across these two departments, which you can read about in my <a href="#cv">CV</a>.</p>

									<p>After undergraduate, I worked as an RA in the <a href="http://changlab.ucsf.edu/">Chang Lab</a> at UCSF. I was involved primarily in the Recovery from Aphasia project, where I collected pre-, post- and intra-operative language assessments from tumor patients. I published my first papers from my work in the Chang Lab, which you can read more about in my <a href="#research">research interests</a>. I noticed a large disconnect between basic science research on aphasia, the brain, and language, and what I was observing in the hospital, which inspired me to apply to the joint PhD/MS in Speech & Hearing Sciences at UT Austin.</p>

									<p>I completed my PhD in Austin, Texas under the tutelage of Dr. Liberty Hamilton. My doctoral research focused on the neural bases of speech production and perception in healthy individuals, which I investigated through EEG and ECoG. My dissertation research is published in <i>Journal of Neuroscience</i> and <i>Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience</i>. I also studied how the neural substrates of speech motor control break down in disorders such as aphasia, apraxia of speech, and stuttering, as well as how we can build brain-computer interfaces for communication to help populations with neurological impairment.</p>

									<p> After my PhD, I continued to work with Dr. Hamilton as a postdoctoral researcher. I recently moved back to California to work with Dr. Greg Hickok at UC Irvine as a postdoc in the <a href="https://sites.uci.edu/alns/">Auditory & Language Neuroscience lab</a> as a part of the <a href="https://cstar.sc.edu/">C-STAR</a> grant. My goal for this position is to provide insight on how different patterns of nervous system damage can lead to different profiles of speech difficulties in people with apraxia of speech.</p>

								<p><i><small><center>Raw EEG recorded from my brain</center></small></i></p>

								<p>As a neuroscientist, linguist, and speech-language pathologist, my research spans a broad interdisciplinary area concerning how the brain gives rise to language. Specifically, I like to straddle the line between clinical practice and basic science research by expanding our knowledge of neural processes that break down in communication disorders. For my PhD research, this focused on speaker-induced suppression, the observation that sounds we produce yield less of a neural response than sounds produced by other people. Speaker-induced suppression is an important biomarker for the speech motor control system, which governs how (among other things) we use our real-time auditory feedback while speaking to ensure we speak accurately to our intentions. Speech motor control is an important cognitive process for several communication disorders, such as stuttering, aphasia, and apraxia of speech.</p>

								<p>My long-term goal as a researcher is to translate to our knowledge of the 
								neural basis of speech production and into "brain-to-speech" brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). I believe that a strong theoretical explanation of how linguistic processes work in the brain is imperative for such devices to exist. I would like to see both consumer and medical BCI for speech and language developed in my lifetime. Right now BCI are being developed for decoding intended speech from neural motor programs, but what if there is a breakdown in the system? How do we adapt our encoding and decoding algorithms to accomodate for apraxia of speech and aphasia? What could creating such a device teach us about these communication disorders?</p>

								<p>I also have a thing about scientific communication, or how scientists like me can make our results understood by the general public and other relevant professions (in my case: neurologists and speech therapists). More specifically, the classic Broca/Wernicke model of language needs to be updated in theory, in medicine, and in undergraduate curricula. At UCSF, I met with patients who had Broca's area resected with no damage to their speech and language functionality just two days after their surgeries. The language network can function without one of the two "fundamental" brain regions, but why? Similarly, I believe there needs to be more room for the insula in neurobiological models of language. Working with stereo EEG depth electrodes during my PhD uncovered a lot of fascinating responses to speech stimuli in the insula: my reseach shows that the insula plays a role in perception and production, and critically, the integration of these dichotomized processes for processing auditory feedback during speech motor control. The absence of the insula from the textbooks generated by my field is, in my opinion, a byproduct of the "pial-centric" view of the neurobiology of language. </p>
